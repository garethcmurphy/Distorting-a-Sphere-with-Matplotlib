# Distorting a Sphere with Matplotlib 🎨🌐  

A collection of Jupyter notebooks for visualizing and distorting a sphere using Matplotlib. This project is designed to demonstrate spherical transformations, custom distortions, and 3D plotting techniques in Python.

---

## Features ✨  

- Generate and visualize 3D spheres with Matplotlib.  
- Apply various distortions and transformations to the sphere.  
- Interactive Jupyter notebooks for hands-on experimentation.  

---

## Prerequisites 🛠️  

- Python 3.8+  
- Required Python libraries:
  - `matplotlib`
  - `numpy`
  - `jupyter`  

Install dependencies:  
pip install matplotlib numpy jupyter

## Installation  

1. Clone the repository:  
git clone https://github.com/your-username/distort-sphere.git  
cd distort-sphere  

2. Launch Jupyter Notebook:  
jupyter notebook  

---

## Usage 🔧  

1. Open the notebook `distort_sphere.ipynb` in Jupyter.  
2. Run the cells to visualize a basic sphere.  
3. Apply and modify distortions by editing the distortion functions in the notebook.
